    "When deploying systems that include Large Language Models (LLMs), it is important to keep in mind certain vulnerabilities in those systems. Just like in any software system, it is impossible to make LLM apps entirely safe. While attacks on \"traditional\" systems require advanced technological skills, it is more intuitive and straightforward to exploit LLM applications - after all you can literally just talk to them. \n",
